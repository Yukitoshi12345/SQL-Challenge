<h1 align = "center"> SQL Challenge </h1>

This project successfully reconstructed and analysed historical employee data from Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company, focussing on the workforce during the 1980s and 1990s. The task involved designing a relational database schema, importing data from six CSV files into a SQL database, and conducting comprehensive data analysis to gain insights into the company’s employment patterns.

The project began with <b>Data Modelling</b>, where an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to define table structures and relationships between employees, departments, titles, and salaries. Appropriate data types, primary keys, and foreign keys were assigned to maintain data integrity and establish connections across tables.

Next, in the <b>Data Engineering</b> phase, the data from the CSV files was imported into a SQL database. Each table was carefully constructed, ensuring all required columns were defined with correct data types, constraints such as `NOT NULL`, and suitable length values. Foreign keys were used to reference related tables, accurately modelling the relationships outlined in the ERD.

Finally, the <b>Data Analysis</b> phase involved executing SQL queries to answer specific questions about the employee records. These queries provided valuable insights, such as employee details, department assignments, managerial roles, hiring trends, and salary information. The analysis helped uncover trends in department composition, employment durations, and common employee names, contributing to a deeper understanding of Pewlett Hackard’s workforce during the late 20th century.

## Data

This project utilises six CSV files to analyse employee and department relationships within a company, focussing on salary distribution, titles, and managerial roles. The dataset, generated by edX Boot Camps LLC and intended for educational purposes, contains detailed information on employees, their associated departments, salaries, and positions. By examining various aspects of the employee database, this project applies data analysis techniques to uncover trends in organisational structure and compensation. These insights support better decision-making for human resources and organisational management.

## Results

### Data Modelling

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the dataset was created using Quick Database Diagrams. This ERD effectively visualises the relationships between the entities such as employees, departments, salaries, and other associated tables, allowing for a clear understanding of how the data is structured.

### Data Engineering

A schema was developed for each of the six CSV files, with data types assigned based on the nature of the data in each file. Primary keys and foreign keys were set to maintain relational integrity, and constraints were added to ensure data validity. For instance, the employee table has `emp_no` as the primary key, and tables like `titles` and `salaries` reference this field as a foreign key to ensure that all records align correctly across tables.

```
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_no VARCHAR(4) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    dept_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Titles (
    title_id VARCHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_no INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    emp_title_id VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (emp_title_id) REFERENCES Titles(title_id),
    birth_date DATE NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    sex VARCHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Salaries (
    emp_no INTEGER NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (emp_no) REFERENCES Employees(emp_no),
    salary INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Dept_Emp (
    emp_no INTEGER NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (emp_no) REFERENCES Employees(emp_no),
    dept_no VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (dept_no) REFERENCES Departments(dept_no)
);

CREATE TABLE Dept_Manager (
    dept_no VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (dept_no) REFERENCES Departments(dept_no),
    emp_no INTEGER NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (emp_no) REFERENCES Employees(emp_no)
);
```

### Data Analysis

A set of SQL queries were used to extract valuable insights from the data, addressing key business questions:

1. <b>Employee Salary Data:</b> A query was run to list each employee's employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary, giving an overview of salary distribution across the workforce. This helps to identify gender diversity and salary levels among employees.

```
SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, e.sex, s.salary
FROM Employees AS e
INNER JOIN Salaries AS s
ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no;
```

2. <b>Employees Hired in 1986:</b> By filtering the data based on hire dates, a list of employees who were hired in 1986 was generated. This analysis is useful for evaluating long-term employees.

```
SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM Employees
WHERE extract(YEAR FROM hire_date) = 1986;
```


3. <b>Department Managers:</b> To identify the managers for each department, a query was run listing their department number, department name, and associated employee information. This provides visibility into the leadership structure of the organisation.

```
SELECT dm.dept_no, d.dept_name, dm.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name
FROM Dept_Manager dm
INNER JOIN Departments d
ON dm.dept_no = d.dept_no
INNER JOIN Employees e
ON dm.emp_no = e.emp_no;

-- OR

SELECT dm.dept_no, 
    (SELECT d.dept_name 
     FROM Departments d 
     WHERE d.dept_no = dm.dept_no) AS dept_name,
    dm.emp_no,
    (SELECT e.last_name 
     FROM Employees e 
     WHERE e.emp_no = dm.emp_no) AS last_name,
    (SELECT e.first_name 
     FROM Employees e 
     WHERE e.emp_no = dm.emp_no) AS first_name
FROM Dept_Manager dm;
```

4. <b>Employee Department Assignment:</b> A query was used to list the department number for each employee, along with their name and department. This helps in understanding how employees are distributed across various departments.

```
SELECT de.dept_no, e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, d.dept_name
FROM Dept_Emp de
INNER JOIN Employees e
ON de.emp_no = e.emp_no
INNER JOIN Departments d
ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no;

-- OR

SELECT de.dept_no, 
       de.emp_no, 
       (SELECT e.last_name 
        FROM Employees e 
        WHERE e.emp_no = de.emp_no) AS last_name, 
       (SELECT e.first_name 
        FROM Employees e 
        WHERE e.emp_no = de.emp_no) AS first_name,
       (SELECT d.dept_name 
        FROM Departments d 
        WHERE d.dept_no = de.dept_no) AS dept_name
FROM Dept_Emp de;
```


5. <b>Employees Named Hercules B:</b> A specific query was executed to find employees whose first name is "Hercules" and whose last name starts with "B", showcasing the ability to filter based on specific name patterns.

```
SELECT first_name, last_name, sex
FROM Employees
WHERE first_name = 'Hercules' AND last_name LIKE 'B%';
```

6. <b>Sales Department Employees:</b> A list was generated to identify all employees in the Sales department, including their employee numbers, last names, and first names. This information can be useful for managing or analyzing the performance of the Sales team.

```
SELECT Employees.emp_no, Employees.first_name, Employees.last_name
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Dept_Emp
ON Employees.emp_no = Dept_Emp.emp_no
INNER JOIN Departments
ON Dept_Emp.dept_no = Departments.dept_no
WHERE Departments.dept_name = 'Sales';

-- OR

SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
FROM Employees
WHERE emp_no IN (
	SELECT emp_no
	FROM Dept_emp
	WHERE dept_no IN (
		SELECT dept_no
		FROM Departments
		WHERE dept_name = 'Sales'))
ORDER BY emp_no;
```

7. <b>Sales and Development Departments Employees:</b> Similarly, a query was run to list employees working in either the Sales or Development departments, highlighting their department name, allowing cross-department comparisons.

```
SELECT e.emp_no, e.first_name, e.last_name
FROM Employees AS e
INNER JOIN Dept_Emp AS de
ON e.emp_no = de.emp_no
INNER JOIN Departments AS d
ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
WHERE d.dept_name IN ('Sales', 'Development');

-- OR

SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name
FROM Employees
WHERE emp_no IN (
	SELECT emp_no
	FROM Dept_Emp
	WHERE dept_no IN (
		(SELECT dept_no
		FROM Departments
		WHERE dept_name = 'Sales' OR dept_name = 'Development')))
ORDER BY emp_no;
```

8. <b>Employee Last Name Frequency:</b> Finally, a query was executed to count how many employees share the same last name, ordered by frequency. This provides interesting insights into common last names within the organization.

```
SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) AS Frequency
FROM Employees
GROUP BY last_name
ORDER BY Frequency DESC;
```
