## Data

This project utilises six CSV files to analyse employee and department relationships within a company, focussing on salary distribution, titles, and managerial roles. The dataset, generated by edX Boot Camps LLC and intended for educational purposes, contains detailed information on employees, their associated departments, salaries, and positions. By examining various aspects of the employee database, this project applies data analysis techniques to uncover trends in organizational structure and compensation. These insights support better decision-making for human resources and organisational management.
